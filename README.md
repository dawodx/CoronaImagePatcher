# CoronaImagePatcher
A patch tool to generate all the possible light condition in a Corona Image Render file.

*Small note: This code was done quickly as a prove of concept, therefore you might find it a bit missy! However, I believe it can be enhanced in many different ways! That's why I'm sharing the idea with the community. So feel free :)*
