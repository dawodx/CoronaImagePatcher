# CoronaImagePatcher
A patch tool to generate all the possible light condition in a Corona Image Render file.
This code automatically manipulate all the light mix parameters in a CXR file and generate all the possible combinations in a render image.

*Small note: This code was done quickly as a prove of concept, therefore you might find it a bit missy! However, I believe it can be enhanced in many different ways! That's why I'm sharing the idea with the community. So feel free :)*

*The render used in the demo was designed by [ENCODE Studio](http://www.encodestudio.net/)*
